This repository contains the LaTeX source for my one-page rÃ©sumÃ©.

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

Installing Latex and it's a mess so use ChatGPT for instructions.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

There's a pip install to do also

```bash
pip install pdf2image
```

And then the CTRL+S will automatically adapt the PDF and convert it to PNG. It's done in settings.json
